# VRChat-Udon-Anti-Cheat-System
{Description}

a simple but very good VRChat anti cheat system :)

this protects against: Collider Flying, Collider Speeding, OVR Advanced Settings Abuse & Sticking heads through walls

this will not prevent someone who is using 3rd party software, that is EAC's job not mine!

{How To Use}

1. make a new U# script and name it "FreneticAntiCheat" then copy & paste the code into it!
2. next make a empty game object and place the U# script on it and then configure the settings as you wish :D
(eventually will be made to work with VRC Creator Companion & have a UnityPackage for easier setup for now its like this because im still adding and updating it pretty frequently)

{Complications}

1. VRChat devs do not allow access to avatars so this is about the best that i can think of for things such as collider flying
2. if the vrchat devs with Udon 2 decide to not be inept then actual things can be created! if access & other things happen with Udon 2 this'll get a update accordingly to hopefully make it better!
3. unfortunately world creators also may not outright ban players from their worlds so this system will detect and allow the creator to either a respawn them after being detected as a cheater or b place them into a per server cheater room to ban players per instance (ik its dumb but its the vrchat devs so what'd you expect from them.)

{Terms}

you may redistribute this code & even edit it! i only ask that you credit me for the code :)
