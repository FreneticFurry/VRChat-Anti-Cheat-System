# VRChat-Udon-Anti-Cheat-System
{Description}

a simple but very good VRChat anti cheat system :)

this protects people from cheating via Colliders, Menu bugging & OVR Advanced settings!

colliders in avatars can be used to fly or gain a intense amount of speed that the player is not meant to have so this prevents that (this will not prevent someone who is using 3rd party software, that is EAC's job not mine!)

{How To Use}

make a new U# script and name it "FreneticAntiCheat" then copy & paste the code into it!
next make a empty game object and place the U# script on it and then configure the settings as you wish :D

{Complications}

VRChat devs do not allow access to avatars so this is about the best that i can think of for things such as collider flying (can be refined further with seeing how long the velocity is going up or a raycast to see if the player continues to go up but either method can be bypassed easily)
if the vrchat devs with Udon 2 decide to not be inept then actual things can be created! if access & other things happen with Udon 2 this'll get a update accordingly to hopefully make it better!
unfortunately world creators also may not outright ban players from their worlds so this system will detect and allow the creator to either a respawn them after being detected as a cheater or b place them into a per server cheater room to ban players per instance (ik its dumb but its the vrchat devs so what'd you expect from them.)

{Terms}

you may redistribute this code & even edit it! i only ask that you credit me for the code :)
