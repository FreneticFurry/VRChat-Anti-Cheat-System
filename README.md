# VRChat-Anti-Cheat-System
{Description}

a simple but very good VRChat anti cheat system :)

this protects people from cheating via Colliders, Menu bugging & OVR Advanced settings!

colliders in avatars can be used to fly or gain a intense amount of speed that the player is not meant to have so this prevents that (this will not prevent someone who is using 3rd party software, that is EAC's job not mine!)
{how to use}

make a new U# script and name it "FreneticAntiCheat" then copy & paste the code into it!
next make a empty game object and place the U# script on it and then configure the settings as you wish :D

{Terms}

you may redistribute this code & even edit it! i only ask that you credit me for the code :)
